# MH3511-Economical-Analysis
## Introduction üìù
In a world where economic stability is often fragile, understanding the past is essential for preparing for the future. The destinies of nations and their people are often at the mercy of financial crises. From the oil crisis of the 1970s to the global financial meltdown of 2008, we have seen European countries experiencing a 4.5% decline in GDP during the first quarter of 2009 and Iceland‚Äôs recession in 2009 as its banking sector collapsed, triggering a severe economic recession. More often than not, many other industries will often be affected or contribute to financial downturns due to the ripple effect. This begs the research question: ‚ÄúWhich sector should least developed countries (LDCs) in South-East Asia (SEA) invest in to quickly improve economic performance?‚Äù

In order to explore further, we need to compare MDCs and LDCs (Q1) and the ratio of economic activities in MDCs and LDCs (Q2) to see the difference between them.

By zooming into ASEAN, we need to research on:
- Why is Singapore considered the most developed country in SEA? (Q3 & Q5)
- What is the difference between SG and other ASEAN countries? (Q4 & Q6)
- Which indicator is the most prevalent in improving GDP in SG? (Q7)
- How is this particular factor affected by other indicators? (Q8)

By formulating these broad questions, we can answer the research question by dwelling deeper to the specialised questions below.

Our project uses a dataset consisting of various economic variables from the year 1970 onwards for 220 Countries. Some of those variables include Gross Domestic Product, Gross National Income, Construction sector and Manufacturing sector. 

Based on this dataset, we will explore the different variables in the dataset and answer the following questions: 

1. How does the GDP per capita fare between the Least Developed Countries (LDCs) and Non-Least Developed Countries (Non-LDCs)?
2. What is the ratio of economic activities that MDCs invest in compared to LDCs? 
3. Is there a significant difference in the GDP per capita between Singapore and Southeast Asia (SEA) countries? 
4. Is there a significant difference in terms of exports and imports of goods and services in SEA countries? 
5. How does Singapore‚Äôs per capita GNI change across the year?
6. Do SEA countries allocate resources in terms of General Government Final Consumption Expenditure? 
7. Which ISIC indicator is most important in affecting the GDP of Singapore?
8. How does the above ISIC indicator get affected by other ISIC factors?
